Different types of selectors: 
1. descendent combinator - div p{...} means the style will apply to <p> which is inside the <div>
2. attribute selector - input[type="text"]{..} means the style will apply to input of text type
3. group selector - h1,div{..} means the style will apply to h1 as well as div
4. pseudo selector - .btn:hover{..} means the style will apply when button is hovered means when mouse is on the button

Box Model - 
every thing is in the box that's why it is called box model. It has 3 things: padding, border, margin

Padding: 
padding take 4 values: top, right, bottom, left to remember this imagine a clock and move in the clockwise direction, padding can't be negative 
if we give 3 values then it will sync with the opposite value, if we give 2 values then also it will take the opposite sides values, if we give 1 value then it will apply to all direction 

Margin: 
Similar to padding but we can use negative values

Display property:
1. inline: make all the text in one line but we can't increase the size of the inline, it will take the space of the text only. Inline means same line
2. inline-block: we can change the size
3. block: it will take the width of whole screen. Block means one after another
